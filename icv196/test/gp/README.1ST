gnuplot functions are located here.

Function plotting examples:
      gnuplot> set sample 500 # amount of samples (default is 100)
      # plot into a file (newer gnuplot --> set table "sine.gp")
      gnuplot> set term table
      gnuplot> set output "sine.gp"

      # Some function examples:
      gnuplot> plot sin(x)
      gnuplot> plot asin (sin (x)) (plot triangular wave)
      gnuplot> plot sin (x), (sin (x) > 0) - 0.5 (plots a sine wave and a square wave)
