To install on a new DSC the BIOS must be modified as follows...

Use the PPC_Mon pci configuration command:

pci <option> dev <slot> <bus number> <base address register> -1 <pci address>.<enable>

<option>                = excl     ;Means exclude this device from the PCI tree
<dev> <slot>            = dev 2    ;This is the lower PMC slot
<bus number>            = 0        ;Bus number zero manages the PMC slots on the CES RIO3
<base address register> = 3        ;BAR3 is the VMIC 64Mb SDRAM address
<pci address>           = dc000000 ;The new PCI BAR3 address moved to LynxOs reserved IO area
-1                      = -1       ;Magic incantation from Akos
<enable>                = e        ;Enable the excluded device at the given pci address

PPC_Mon>pci excl dev 2 0 3 -1 dc000000.e
PPC_Mon>pci show excl
PPC_mon>pci show dev 2

To remove the pci exclude and go back to standard BIOS configuration

PPC_Mon>pci excl clear all
PPC_Mon>pci show excl

==============================================

About the handling of PendingInit interrupts.

A protocol is implemented between nodes in which at least one client on each node
must be connected to the PendingInit interrupt. Nodes that have no connection to
PendingInit do not activley take part in this protocol.

When a node comes up after a reboot, it may need to be initialized from other
nodes that must flush their segment contents to the new node. The new node
must connect to the interrupt XmemDrvrIntrPENDING_INIT (0x0080) and then issue
an XmemDrvrSEND_INTERRUPT IOCTL call as follows ...

XmemDrvrSendBuf sbuf;

   sbuf.Module        = <ModuleId>
   sbuf.UnicastNodeId = 0;
   sbuf.MulticastMask = 0;
   sbuf.Data          = 1 << (<NodeId> -1);
   sbuf.InterruptType = XmemDrvrNicINITIALIZED
		      | XmemDrvrNicBROADCAST;
   if (ioctl(xmem,XmemDrvrSEND_INTERRUPT,&sbuf) < 0) {

Another way to send out this message is to simply perform a driver RESET.
N.B. The reset logic will not send the message if there is no connection.
In any case all nodes receiving this message will reply but with zero in the
data value, and all drivers connected to this interrupt will make note of all
the sending NodeIds. In this case the functioning nodes connected to PendingInit
can be discovered in real time to keep track of which nodes are up and which
nodes have been removed. As all nodes now know who is involved in PendingInit
handling, some algorithum, say, highest node number, can be implemented.
To obtain a bit mask with one bit set per connected node see: XmemDrvrGET_NODES
N.B. If you send the message with zero in data, no replies are made, but
all connected nodes will add your NodeId to their list.
