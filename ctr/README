There are three bz2 archives that are derrived from the tarballs directory.
The tarballs are stand alone and can be used by people outside CERN or the control system
To build a tarball cd into tarballs and type
tar -cjf <out file>.bz2 <directory>
Then move the result to where you want it.

For the latest control system versions go to the appropriate directory and
make CPU=L865 KVER=<what ever kernel version>
make CPU=L865 KVER=<what ever kernel version> deliver lab/oper/oplhc

Obviously you should be very carfull installing a modified driver.

The ctr-linux.bz2 is a tar of this entire directory
