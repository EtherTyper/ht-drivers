The tarballs are built from sources the commonn sources.
Each tar directory has a src subdirectory, the sources are copied
by using the shell scripts here.
Because these tarballs are "stand alone" we also keep an RCS backup.

To build the sources
1) cd to src in the tarball
2) co -l RCS/*
3) cd to here
4) run the script that copies the sources to src
5) cd back to src
6) ci RCS/*
