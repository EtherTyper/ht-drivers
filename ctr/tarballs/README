The tarballs are built from sources the commonn sources.
Each tar directory has a src subdirectory, the sources are copied
by using the shell scripts here.
Because these tarballs are "stand alone" we also keep an RCS backup.

To build the tarball sources ...

   make_sources_tar_pci
   make_sources_tar_vme


To compare the sources ...

   compare_sources_tar_pci
   compare_sources_tar_vme
