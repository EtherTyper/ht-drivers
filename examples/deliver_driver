# HOWTO deliver drivers to the CERN-predefined standart pathes
#
#  User should _always_ provide CPU variable.
#+ In the command line, or in Makefile.specific
#+ If KVER is not provided - default one will be taken.

#  Will deliver the driver with default KVER or KVER from Makefile.specific
#+ (if it is set there)
make deliver CPU=L865

# Will compile with user-defined CPU && KVER
make deliver CPU=L865 KVER=2.6.24.7-rt27

#  Compile with CPU && KVER that are taken from the Makefile.specific
#+ Note, that if CPU is not provided (in Makefile.specific or command line) -
#+ will error-terminate.
