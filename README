First of all - pay in mind, that it's (still) not perfect. 
There are some rules and limitations on HOWTO use CDCM.
One should take care following this rules and limitations.

Here comes the 'limitation list' 

1. 'struct file' that is passed into the common part of the LynxOS-like code 
    is screwed up in case of Linux!! It's adapted partially.


2. Stream task limitatioins.
----------------------------
   For now there is no way to emulate LynxOS threads completely.
   The 'oblitary code demand' concerns a function that is passed as a payload 
   function to 'ststart' call (firs parameter of ststart). 
   Let's examain it in more details:
   Usually, a stream task payload is looped in a cycle, doing it's work.
   The demand for this functions is that
   EACH TIME BEFORE TO JUMP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LOOP - ONE SHOULD INSERT
   A PREDEFINED CDCM MACRO IN IT'S CODE.
   The macro is 'CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN'.

   The only perpose of this macro is to be able to quit (or to kill, as you
   prefer) system thread on Linux platform. Othervise it's not possible to get
   out of the 'for' loop. Note that we are speaking only about Linux platform.
   Want to know why? Here you go:
   It's not possible to add signal handler to kernel thread in Linux.
   They will never been called. Signals are delivered only on exit from kernel
   mode (which happens either at the end of a syscall or after interrupt, which
   may have caused the signal), scheduling being a special case ot this.
   Since kernel thread never leaves a kernel mode, the code to run signal
   handlers is never executed.

   Here are some examples that illustrates how stream task should look like
   in CDCM:

----------------------------------+---------------------------------
	Normal Lynx thread        |        CDCM adapted Lynx thread
----------------------------------+---------------------------------
                                  |
   void kthread(void param) {     |   void kthread(void param) {     
	  for (;;) {              |          for (;;) {  
	    ....                  |            ...
	    /* do the job */      |            /* do the job */ 
	    ...                   |            ... 
	  }                       |            CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN;
	}                         |          } 
                                  |        }
----------------------------------+---------------------------------
                                  |
   void kthread(void param) {     |   void kthread(void param) {
	  do {                    |          do {
	    ...                   |            ...
	    /* payload */         |            /* payload */
	    ...                   |            ... 
	  } while (1)             |            CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN;  
	}                         |          } while (1)
                                  |        }
----------------------------------+---------------------------------     
                                  |
   void kthread(void param) {     |    void kthread(void param) {
	tag:                      |         tag: 
	...                       |         ...
	/* do the job here */     |         /* do the job here */
	...                       |         ...
	goto tag;                 |         CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN; 
	}                         |         goto tag;
                                  |         }
----------------------------------+---------------------------------

   As you can see - all 'adapted' functions contain CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN macro just
   before the end of the loop cycle. This is the bottleneck of thread stub
   implementation, because already existing driver code will not be completely
   portable. It should be affected (CDCM_LOOP_AGAIN macro insertion) to be
   able to run under Linux.


3. Copy data to/from user address space.
----------------------------------------
   Special CDCM functions can be used when transferring data to/from user
   address space. These functions are:

   A. cdcm_copy_from_user(void *to, void *from, int size)
   B. cdcm_copy_to_user(void *to, void *from, int size)

4. DMA API
----------
Documentation to be written.

5. Interrupt handler
--------------------
Documentation to be written.

6. Return values to user-space
------------------------------
Programs that run in user space always see -1 as the error return value.
They need to access the errno variable to find out what happened; this is
imposed by the POSIX standard. 
For CDCM-compliant drivers we follow the LynxOs approach:
* If an error happens, first set pseterr(code), where code is one of the
POSIX error codes defined in include/errno.h.
* Once the error code has been set, return SYSERR.

Note that the procedure below refers _only_ to the communication between 
the kernel and user-space, which is defined by POSIX (i.e. this standard
does not make requirements on how the kernel operates internally).

Sources: LynxOS man, ldd3@pp66.

7. Timeouts
-----------
Timeouts respect the original LynxOs interface (man timeout).
The interval passed to the timeout is the number of ticks we want to wait.
Since all the LynxOS boxes we run have 100 ticks per second (i.e. 1 tick
every 10ms), we have decided that timeout assumes that value when getting the
ticks interval from the user. This does _not_ mean that all our machines
are configured with tickspersec=100 (NB. tickspersec is HZ in Linux); it 
means that irrespective of the machine you're running on, if you want 
to wait, say 40ms, then you give to timeout() an interval of 4 ticks.

8. I/O operations
-----------------
I/O operations to/from hardware must be done using the provided helpers 
cdcm_io{read,write}{8,16,32}(). The address fed to these helpers is a void
pointer, *not* volatile. The reason is well explained in the Linux kernel
documentation ('Documentation/volatile-considered-harmful.txt'). Basically
proceeding this way has two benefits:
- Code portability
- No memory barriers needed (since they are included in the helpers)

Bear in mind endianness issues when dealing with hardware: use the 
provided helpers to swap according to the host machine endianness and that
of the hardware (cdcm_cpu_to_le{16,32,64},etc.).

Use fixed-width types to describe hardware (ideally use standard C99 types).

In the (rare) case you need a memory barrier, use the helpers provided
(cdcm_{mb,rmb,wmb}) and insert a comment to explain why you need the barrier.
