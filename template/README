Template for skel drivers
-------------------------

- myDrvr.c: this is the basic driver template -- which is a base to
	provide the skel infrastructure.
	This file usually goes into the myModule/driver directory.

- skeluser.h: definitions needed by 'skel' -- such as desired number
	of contexts, modules, etc.
	Directory: myModule/driver o myModule/include (as you wish)

- skeluser_ioctl.h: IOCTL numbers for the driver -- note that these
	shouldn't clash with those of 'skel' (As long as you
	use letters in the alphabet as the magic number, they won't
	clash). Note also that there are some names that need to be
	kept as they are in the template file -- read the comments
	in the file for further info.
	Directory: myModule/driver o myModule/include (as you wish)
